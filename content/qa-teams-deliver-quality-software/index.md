Being a Quality Analyst, it’s our responsibility to run test cycles on the system and push releases every two weeks to make sure the system is also updated with the latest fixes and everything is bug free on the live platform. Normally every release includes amendments as well as fixes done. If we talk about the resources then normally the team has 8-10 resources including developers and QA team.

Therefore, we should always be pre-active about every release and to avoid any stress during the release everything has to be managed properly when it comes to execution from development end or testing from QA end. For that purpose we have to follow proper strategies to ensure that everything is being tested properly and the release which we approve met the expected quality standards.
  

### Break away from the conventional roles and obligations of QA 

We have penetrated limits in the two ways. In this day and age we are a client confronting unit, as we get with our clients straightforwardly about their issues which they experience over the software or what are the highlights which they need to join on the stage. Also we are actively participating on the design discussions, or if any inputs required from our end which we receive from clients’ end to make sure we are going on right direction as per client’s vision.  Along with, our experience of testing always helps to detect any flaw or defects before doing any coding work which helps to reduce additional efforts and minimize the work. This way we can ensure to have everything done based on client given timeline and a quality outcome.

### Opt for releases very carefully

As its impractical to test everything each time at whatever point you push any delivery. For that reason you simply need to focus on the piece of code which has been chipped away at, this way you can really test the primary piece of work without postponing things and afterward run a total test cycle to ensure no other part has been clashed by the changes. For this reason, at whatever point there is new delivery check with group what piece of code has been refreshed and what are the results, and generally center around that part to run tests. This way you can focus on the work and endeavors which should be put. We center around those pieces of the code and utilize existing computerization tests to deal with different parts. In the event that you realize something worked in the last delivery and you're not contacting it in this delivery, at that point you don't have to invest an excessive amount of time on testing. So base your delivery standards on new code that is being added.


### Always have a proper plan based on priorities  

QA has to make sure that whatever work needs to be done, is properly prioritized. For example, if particular area of a platform is not affecting things much and can be taken care at later stage then it should be on the lowest priority; If less than one percent of our users are on a particular browser, issues specific to that browser stand out enough to be noticed.  And the area which is affecting the whole system should be done on the very first priority. There should be priorities defined like – Blocker, Emergency, Highest, High, Normal, and Low!  So always work as per the required attention on specific area of feature, also need to consider the target user demands. What is their feedback or issues which they want to have access on. If something moved beyond us and clients find bugs, those bugs get need for fixes in the following release.

  

### Always make sure to have proper environments ready!

You will often hear from the development team that, “…. It works fine with me; there must be some network issue or system issue on your end”. We have to make sure not to have such conflicts in between, because at the end our goal has to be – Delivering bug free solution!  
For that purpose, Our QA and development teams run their tests in exactly the same environment. As our builds move through the development pipeline, however, we should test the code under production environment, so we build our staging environment to simulate our customers' production environments.

  
### Set up a dedicated performance testing team

Always plan to arrange a dedicated performance team who can run tests as soon as a product is steady, and tell the team about new versions and requirements so that they can evaluate the performance risks. 
And to update performance teams with all latest information and provide them with an environment as close to production as you can. To make sure that there shouldn’t be any gaps in between and the product can be tested properly. 


### Run a regression cycle

QA team run regression tests in the last phase of the product cycle, and it is that process that gives the confirmation for the product delivery. If any of the regression tests fails, QA informs the managers / stakeholders so that appropriate actions can be taken for further release. As it’s never acceptable to deliver the product if any of the tests fails which might end up in bigger problems for the team as well as the client. So the QA team always makes sure to run regression tests to properly verify everything. 
We additionally automate our regression cycle, so it just requires a couple of days to run.


### Production environment testing on customer accounts is necessary 

As we maintain customer data in our database collections, we need to guarantee that it should remain attuned with any new versions that have been released or about to release. Whenever we release a new version, we run several updates to check that no data was harmed, and in case we find any data-corrupting bugs, those become our highest priority. We also perform manual backwards compatibility testing while we take steps towards finding an automated and more efficient approach. Nonetheless, you actually need to do some manual testing, as this is one of the last stages before production.

### Sanity testing on production environment 

We perform post-release sanity tests on our production account to authorize that everything works as projected, including all third-party systems. We initially perform tests utilizing our existing production account but then create a new account to check that the process will continue to work correctly as new customers register.

### In a nutshell:

The best testing practices should inculcate all other processes in general and risk management processes in particular in them. The focus should be to improve the overall quality of the software while aiming for reducing the cost with continuous monitoring during and after the release of the software. While doing quality assurance testing, the tester should ensure to comply with all the fundamental principles and industry practices; along with looking at the product from the end-users’ perspective.
