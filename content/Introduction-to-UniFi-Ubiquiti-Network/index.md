## Overview

UniFi is a community of wireless access points, switches, routers, controller devices, VoIP phones, and access control products. It can be used for the corporate network and also for the home network. All the equipment in the UNIFI network is managed by an Unifi network controller. The best part of the Unifi network is that its Unifi Network Controller can be hosted online with a Ubiquiti account using an Unifi Cloud Key, which gives online access to the network to manage the Unifi devices and also the connected client so, most of the operations can be managed remotely.

## Benefits of Ubiquiti UniFi Network
 **1. Easy Deployment**

Having an UniFi Controller on the cloud allows us easy deployment of hardware. On any UniFi network where we have UniFi Security Gateway (USG) Installed, any UniFi equipment plugged into the network is immediately recognized by the Unifi Controller and that is also ready for the adoption. Whenever the controller adopts the device, the device receives the correct configuration and comes up in the network within a short span of time.

**2. Reduced Operating and Hardware Cost**

UniFi devices are ideal for most of the small businesses, and even for some medium sized businesses because they don’t need the extra cost to buy high price products like cisco enterprise equipment. Business can achieve almost the same performance with Ubiquiti products. Many of the products are advanced enterprise hardwares, which most people don’t even need also, so Ubiquiti makes sense for smaller businesses that want enterprise grade equipment.

**3. Simplified Length of Service**

UniFi products are built to be controlled remotely. All the Unifi products are designed with upgrades in mind, they keep getting updates over a span of time for the new feature upgradation and the bug fixes also.

**4. Total Visibility**

In UniFi network, the user can see everything that what is  going on in their network, from connected clients, total traffic, to speed and throughput tests, to information broken down into individual protocol using deep packet inspection, it’s all available right in the UniFi Controller.UniFi Controller offers information about your network, how it is being used and by that insight we can optimize the network for better efficiency. 

## Conclusion

Having an Unifi network at the office or home can be more satisfying in terms of deployment of the devices and monitoring of the network.  An Unifi controller gives transparency to the network.
